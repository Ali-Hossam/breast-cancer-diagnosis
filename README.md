# Breast Cancer Diagnosis Notebook

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that performs an analysis for breast cancer diagnosis. The notebook explores a breast cancer dataset, performs data preprocessing, and builds machine learning models to classify breast tumors as either malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous).

## Dataset Description

The breast cancer diagnosis dataset contains various features extracted from digitized images of breast mass samples. These features include characteristics such as the radius, texture, perimeter, area, smoothness, and more. The dataset is commonly used for breast cancer classification tasks and is often employed to develop accurate diagnostic models.
